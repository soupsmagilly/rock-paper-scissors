# rockpaperscissors
This is the Rock, Paper, Scissors game from The Odin Project. The player takes on the computer for a classic game of rock, paper scissors. The first one to make it to five points wins, and a winner is delcared. When the pade is reloaded the game starts again. 

What I learned:
How to randomly select items out of an array, call functions, manipulate the DOM, and organize a project with HTML, Javascript and CSS.
